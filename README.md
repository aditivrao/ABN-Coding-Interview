# ABN-Coding-Interview

The coding challenge was done in Python 3.7 using the Spyder user interface. The Code follows the order of the questions/ instructions in the exercise.md file as sent over by ABN. 

The first few lines are direct answers. Additionally, 3 user-defined functions are created for multiple purposes:
1. Creates subset of clients for email promotion based on country and file path inputs
2. Helps rename columns easily with arguments data, original column name, new column name
3. Helps filter data easily with arguments data, column names and filter values 

Comments are given wherever possible. And sample function calls are also given. 
client_data.csv has the final output
